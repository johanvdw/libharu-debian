This package was downloaded from   <http://libharu.org>
 
It was repacked after removal of:
demo/pngsuite: non dfsg-free license
demo/type1: fonts already in package gsfonts
demo/ttfont: font already in package ttf-dustin
demo/*.pdf: binary files
win32/: binary files and/or unneeded files for debian build

These steps can be done again running debian/rules get-orig-source
